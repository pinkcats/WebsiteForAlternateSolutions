					<h2 id="sec2">Why us?</h2>
					<p>
						I have been making more than my share of mistakes lately and my boss is really getting 
						on my case. I think that I understand the directions that people are giving me, but when 
						I give them the final work product it seems that I've missed something or have not completed 
						the task as they expected. It looks to me like most of my mistakes happen when I get verbal 
						directions for what I am expected to do and the person giving them to me is in a hurry. We've 
						become extremely busy in the last year and the pace has really picked up for all of us. My boss 
						says that the mistakes are my fault because Iâ€™m not a good listener. How can I become a better 
						listener when it seems like we're always in a rush?
					</p>
					<p>
						It could be said that most workers receive half of their paycheck for listening but many of us 
						can't say that we are always good listeners. In fact, poor listening can be cited as the cause 
						for many costly mistakes in the workplace. We may hear with our ears but listening requires far 
						more than our auditory systems to be in working order. Good listening doesn't just happen - it 
						takes skill building and effort. Try these tips to improve your listening.
