					<h2 id="sec0">Mediation</h2>
					<p>
						Mediation provides a unique intervention approach to 
						conflict resolution in which conflict is viewed as an opportunity for growth and change.  
						Participants themselves define the conflict and create the solutions.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Mediation is a voluntary process in which parties choose to work together with an impartial third party (mediator) to resolve their conflict in a mutually beneficial way.  
						It is a confidential, uniquely flexible process that can be tailored to meet a wide variety of situations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because people in conflict are understandably defensive and self-absorbed in protecting their own interests, communication becomes difficult.  
						Mediation provides the opportunity for each person to clearly and effectively communicate their concerns and needs, 
						and to develop an understanding of another partyâ€™s perspective.  Mediation is effective because it goes beyond what appears to be the problem, 
						to address the root of the problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						Parties in mediation are encouraged to recognize that they have within themselves the ability to deal positively with the conflict because they know better than anyone what they need for resolution.  
						Through the process, parties will identify and develop their own resources and strategies to address both substantive and relational issues.  
						Decision-making power is in the hands of those most closely involved with the situation; those who will live the outcome, rather than a third party.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rather than focus on the harms of the past, mediation focuses on the opportunities of the future.  
						Because mediation fosters an environment of respect and trust, participants are able to maintain dignity throughout the entire process.  
						Mediation humanizes a dispute in a way that an adversarial process such as litigation or arbitration cannot.  No one faces "losing" to the other party.  
						This aspect is especially important when ongoing, long-term relationships are involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mediation is a dynamic field which requires a skilled professional to achieve optimal results.
						Mediations can be scheduled and completed much faster than litigation.  
						Studies indicate success rates ranging between 80% and 90% with equally high levels of satisfaction.
