					<h2 id="sec0">Facilitation</h2>
					<p>
						A process in which an impartial third party (facilitator) works with a group by helping group members communicate 
						and problem-solve productively, resulting in high quality decisions.  
						The facilitator provides structure so the group can address the content.
					</p>
					<p>
						Effective communication is the most critical component of any productive group discussion.  
						Facilitated meetings provide opportunities for all group members to actively participate in the discussion.  
						Facilitators use skills that provide opportunities for all participants to constructively express opinions and viewpoints.  
						They can draw out the quiet members of the group and manage disruptive behaviors.  
						Balance in a process is especially important when there are inequities in levels of authority, power, and/or influence. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Because our facilitators have no vested interest in the outcomes, we can help groups objectively define and frame issues for effective problem-solving.  
						A critical aspect of the facilitator's role is to help groups design processes to gather relevant 
						information and develop criteria in order to generate and weigh multiple options, make decisions, and evaluate the effectiveness of implemented solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						While conflict can destroy a group’s ability to function together, when appropriately managed, 
						it can stimulate thinking and even energize the group.  
						Our facilitators are highly skilled in all aspects of conflict management to assist groups to effectively address differences so 
						that conflict can be a constructive force in the group process.
