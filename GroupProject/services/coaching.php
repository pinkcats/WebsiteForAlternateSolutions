					<p>
						Coaching is a learning partnership for generating creative, purposeful action toward one person's goals and desires.  
						It is an effective means to help people improve job performance, build leadership skills, and remove obstacles blocking their path to success.
					</p>
					<p>
						Coaching is a relationship between a coach and a willing individual that operates in an environment of respect, trust, safety, challenge and accountability.  
						Coaching is truly about one person helping another to excel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Working with a coach can provide energy and motivation to achieve the goals and specific outcomes that are important for success.  
						Utilizing a coach can be especially helpful when:
						<ul>
							<li>An individual has a style of relating or interacting that is ineffective or is not supporting the achievement of one’s personally relevant goals</li>
							<li>There is a gap in knowledge, skills, confidence, or resources</li>
							<li>There is something at stake (a challenge, stretch goal or opportunity), and it is urgent, compelling, exciting or all of the above</li>
							<li>There is a need for a course correction in work or life due to a setback</li>
							<li>There is a need to make career choices and a lack of clarity about what to do</li>
							<li>Work and life are out of balance, creating unwanted consequences</li>
							<li>There is a need and a desire to better organized and more self-managing</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						The coach serves as an ally who non-judgmentally guides and supports the client in reaching his or her stated purpose and goals.  
						During coaching sessions, the coach is always present in service of the client.  
						The coach is there to challenge the person being coached to consider new perspectives and 
						different approaches - to "stretch" beyond where they are today in a specific area or areas.
					</p>
					<p>
						The primary goal of the coach is to help the client achieve his or her goals in a way that, over time, reduces dependence on the coach.  
						The coaching process is focused on helping the client access both internal and external resources to draw upon in the future.
