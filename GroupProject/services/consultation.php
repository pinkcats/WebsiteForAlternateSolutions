					<h2 id="sec0">Consultation</h2>
					<p>
						In order to effectively address organizational needs, an organization must first understand the scope of the need.
						A consultant with specific expertise works with a client to identify the problem, recommend possible solutions/services, and identify available resources.  
						The objectivity of the consultant provides valuable insight.  By partnering with the client, the client is actively engaged in addressing organizational 
						issues and conflicts, with the support of the consultant’s expertise.  The most frequent needs of organizations fall into these categories.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Needs Assessment. </span>
						The objective of a Needs Assessment is to assess 
						the overall workplace environment/climate as it 
						relates to managing communication, conflict, and 
						change for effective teamwork.  Information is 
						gathered confidentially and individually and is used 	
						to pinpoint and highlight opportunities for 
						improvement, identify issues and concerns, determine appropriate responses to address issues, 
						and determine the necessary parties for participation 
						in recommended processes.  A written report of the 
						findings and recommendations is presented.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Facilitating Change. </span>
						Change is something that people do, not something 
						that is done to them.  Successful organizations 
						anticipate and purposefully plan for it.  Just as 
						implementing an organizational change is a process, 
						so it is with individual acceptance of change.  Change 
						must be addressed in an intentional, goal-oriented 
						manner that includes ongoing open communication, 
						joint problem solving, and appropriate resources.  
						Involvement in planning and implementing 
						change helps people maintain a sense of control, 					
						reduces fears and increases their buy-in, resulting in 
						a successful change process.   
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Team Building. </span>
						Cohesive teams are the cornerstone of successful 
						organizations.  In order to achieve its' goals and 
						objectives, an organization must have people who 
						trust in one anothers' capabilities and motives.   					
						Effective teams demonstrate good communication, 
						coordination and cooperation.  Individual and 
						collective accountability is a given.  Purposeful 
						efforts must be made to prepare a group of people to 
						function as a team—appropriate technical, problem-					
						solving and communication skills must be developed.  
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">External Support Services. </span>
						Services and support for issues involving parties 
						outside the	organization such as clients, vendors, 
						and customers.  Materials include process guides, 
						tips, and newsletter articles.
