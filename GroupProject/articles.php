							<h3>When You Understand Resistance to Change You Can Overcome It</h3>
							<p>
								In order to deal with the downturn in the economy we're going to have to 
								make some big changes within the next year.  If everybody gets on board, 
								we can continue to be profitable and no jobs will be lost.  Unfortunately, 
								many people here really hate change and I'm expecting a lot of resistance.  
								How can I set the stage to overcome the resistance?
							</p>
							<p>
								Change is inevitable and so is some resistance to change.  When you understand 
								the primary reasons why people resist change you will discover creative ways to 
								help your employees accept, and maybe even welcome, change.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Habit. </span>  
								We form habits to create consistency and predictability in our environment. 
								Change creates disorder as it requires forming new habits to replace old familiar ones.  
								Give people reasonable time to adjust and develop the necessary new habits.  
								It takes at least 21 consecutive days for a behavior to become a habit so don't 
								assume that lack of instant compliance is resistance.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Security. </span>  
								Workplace change is often perceived to threaten job security.  
								Listen carefully to employees concerns, fears, and insecurities so you can address them effectively.  
								Set clear policies and procedures to guide the change and provide stability.  
								Provide appropriate training and follow up to demonstrate your commitment to preserving current jobs.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Fear of the Unknown. </span>
								Letting go of the familiar to make room for the unknown is uncomfortable.  
								Employees may experience some of the same apprehension they felt when they first came on board.  
								Orient all employees to new ways of doing things utilizing similar practices as those used 
								to onboard new employees.  Include employees in decision-making whenever possible- it's hard to resist change you helped create.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Selective Information Processing: </span>
								People create a world that is comfortable for them and try to tune out information that alters it.  
								It's the old, "what I don't know can't hurt me" approach.  Develop a plan to communicate as much information as possible, as often as possible.  
								Repeat the message in a variety of formats - email, newsletter, stand-up talks, listening sessions, etc.  
								Because workers respond more positively to information shared directly by their immediate supervisor, 
								the attitude of that supervisor is critical.  An "I don't agree with this change but we're stuck with it,"  attitude sets the stage for resistance.  
								A positive attitude supportive of the change sets the stage for buy-in and employee support.
							</p>
							<p>
								When change is effectively managed, it is more likely for employees to embrace it than resist it.

							<h3>Holiday Celebrations Need to Respect Differences</h3>
							<p>
								The Christmas decorations are being hung in my department, soon to be followed by seasonal music, holiday treats, Secret Santas, and other Christmas traditions.   
								As the manager, I have supported holiday celebrations as a way to bring fun, festivity, and caring into our workplace but this year I'm already hearing some complaints.  
								Some are grumbling that all the merry-making just gets in the way of productivity while others are concerned about financial and other expectations.  
								Those who appreciate the traditions are calling them a bunch of Scrooges.  If celebrating the holidays is just going to cause divisions, 
								maybe I should just pull the plug on holiday activities.
							</p>
							<p>
								All work and no play makes for a dull, unfriendly workplace.  A little fun and good cheer go a long way toward making work enjoyable.  
								Problems often arise, however, when only some decide what fun, festivity and caring should look like, yet everyone is expected to participate.  
								Make this holiday season enjoyable for everyone with these tips.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Adjust attitudes. </span>  
								In any workplace there are likely to be different ideas about which holidays should be celebrated and how.  
								Help your staff to realize that conflicts resulting from differences don't get resolved with name calling and judgments about right and wrong.  
								When they can begin to respect each other's preferences, you can all make better decisions about what makes sense for your department. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Be realistic about expectations. </span>  
								Some people may not celebrate Christmas due to religious, cultural or personal beliefs while others may be passionate about their own traditions.  
								Some may get energized by all of the activities; others may find it somewhat overwhelming in addition to their other responsibilities and commitments. 
								In any case, when one is expected to participate in something not of one's choosing, you can expect to encounter grumbling and even resentment.  
								Giving people a choice, and a way to opt out of activities without judgment, allows them to take care of themselves and to feel respected.
							</p>
							<p>
								<span class="bold">Set boundaries around celebrating. </span>
								A "festive" atmosphere creates distractions, both physical and emotional, that can get in the way of getting the job done.  
								While some people's work load may lighten during the holiday season, for others it can be a peak time because of seasonal demands, year-end requirements, or simply being new.  
								Make sure that the festivities are confined to places and times that are appropriate for all.
							</p>
							<p>
								A truly caring work environment honors and respects the needs of all.
